I am a Post Doc at the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en), Aarhus University, Denmark. Broadly, my work focuses on how the evolved human mind navigates the political and social world. My PhD dissertation investigated the role of intentions and competence in political leader evaluations, relying on quantitative and experimental methods. Currently, I am working on a project investigating the causes and consequences of hostility in online political discussions.

I am also interested in facial appearance, morality and economic voting. I am an R enthusiast fascinated with data vizualization. I do my best to promote and live up to the standards of open science.
