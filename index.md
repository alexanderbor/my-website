# {{ site.author }}

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en), Aarhus University, Denmark. Broadly, my work focuses on how the evolved human mind navigates the political and social world. My dissertation is investigating the role of intentions and competence in political leader evaluations, relying on quantitative and experimental methods. 

I am also interested in facial appearance, morality and economic voting. I am an R enthusiast fascinated with data vizualization. I do my best to promote and live up to the standards of open science. 

You can find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/szasulja), on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=dwd7NJUAAAAJ&hl=en), on [OSF](osf.io/cquyz) or in my office (Bartholins All√© 7, 1341-122. 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark).
