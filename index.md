I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.au.dk/en), Aarhus University, Denmark. Broadly, my work focuses on how the evolved human mind navigates modern political and social world. My dissertation is investigating the role of intentions and competence in political leader evaluations. It is relying on quantitative and experimental methods. 

I am also interested in morality, facial appearance and economic voting. I am an R enthusiast fascinated with data vizualization. I do my best to promote and live up to the standards of open science.
