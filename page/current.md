Bor A. **Correcting for base-rates in multidimensional who-said-what experiments.**  
ABSTRACT The ‘Who said what?’ protocol is a popular experimental paradigm, which has been used for 40 years to study spontaneous mental categorization. This paper argues that the base-rate correction method used in most multidimensional ‘Who said what?’ studies is flawed. The practice of first correcting the base rates and consequently aggregating errors for the two dimensions separately biases the estimates towards the mean of the two scores. This is demonstrated with a large simulation of over 175,000 experiments and the re-analysis of a pivotal study. The flawed practice biases categorization estimates and may increase both false-positive and false-negative error rates in treatment effects. Researchers should instead aggregate errors for each dimension and then correct for base rates.

Bor A. & Laustsen L. **Partisan motivation and candidate traits - Trustworthiness matters more for out-party than in-party candidate evaluations.**  
ABSTRACT It is well known that partisans are biased to view their own candidates through rose-colored glasses but see competing candidates in a much more negative light. However, recent advances in political behavior research reveal that motivated reasoning is not simply about love and hate but may also promote more nuanced shifts in preferences. We incorporate this insight into the novel trend of studying the importance of specific character traits on candidate evaluations. Specifically, we propose that as the ill intentions of an out-party candidate are much more likely to be costly for a voter than similar intentions of an in-party candidate, people need to pay special attention to the former’s trustworthiness. We test this prediction using all available representative election surveys including voter impressions of candidate trustworthiness encompassing twenty-three elections from a diverse set of seven countries (Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, UK, and USA) and spanning two decades. We find that trustworthiness in out-party candidates is consistently more strongly associated with global candidate evaluations than for in-party candidates. Importantly, the heterogeneous role played by trustworthiness in out- and in-party candidate evaluations is contrasted with competence and strong leadership, two other influential character traits in candidate evaluations, which are not weighted more heavily for out-party candidates. The results stress the importance of applying a multifaceted framework of candidate character and that impressions of trustworthiness, in particular, are intertwined with partisan-based reasoning about candidates. We conclude by discussing the implications of the results for models of candidate evaluations, party switching and citizens’ acceptance of authoritative decisions.

Bor A., Mazepus H, Bokemper S. & Descioli P. **When should the majority rule? Experimental evidence for Madisonian judgments in five cultures**

ABSTRACT Societies need to make collective decisions even when individuals disagree. In diverse settings from governments to small groups, people use multiple basic rules for collective choice including voting, consensus, leadership, and chance, along with many intricate elaborations of these rules. Here we study the psychology behind how people think that groups should decide, focusing especially on when they think voting is appropriate. Participants in five countries read scenarios about a small group that needs to make a collective decision even though they disagree. In a between-subject design, we manipulated whether the group had a vulnerable minority—a smaller number of people who had more at stake than the majority. We find that participants from all five countries generally preferred majority-rule voting for collective decisions, but when the group included a vulnerable minority, participants opposed voting and instead preferred consensus for making the group’s choice. We discuss implications for how people judge the legitimacy of voting as a rule for resolving societal disagreements.
